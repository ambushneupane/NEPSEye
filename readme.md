# NEPSEye

NEPSEye is a small Firefox extension built to quickly view the NEPSE index and market turnover without constantly opening the NEPSE website. It started as a personal tool to save a few seconds each time while keeping important market information easily accessible.

## Features
- NEPSE index overview
- Market turnover display
- Portfolio holdings view
- Profit / Loss (P&L) calculation

## Planned features
- Top gainers
- Top losers
- Top volume stocks

> Some features are still under development and will be added gradually.

## Why this exists
I built this extension because I didn’t want to keep checking the NEPSE website throughout the day. Most of the time, a quick glance is enough, and saving a few seconds repeatedly helps with focus and productivity.

## Current status
This project is in an early stage.
- Basic UI and layout are implemented
- Index and turnover display works
- Additional market and portfolio features are planned

1. Clone this repository
2. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging`
